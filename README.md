# Note Taker

## Description

This is a simple website where a user can create, view and add notes. It uses a simple express setup and a json file as the backend.

## Usage

Upon opening the page, users will go to the landing page. They will click the "Get Started" button, which will take them to the "notes" page (if they desire to go back to the landing page they can click the link in the upper left that says "Note Taker"). It will show a page with no notes (unless the user has already added notes). To add notes, the user clicks the plus sign in the upper left (Initially the lefthand side of the page will be open to this screen). Once they've filled out a title and text, a save icon will appear next to the plus icon. Clicking it will save the note, and it will appear in the list to the right. Clicking on any of the note entries will show the details of the note. Each note has a red trash can icon on it. Clicking that will delete the note.

Adding a note:
